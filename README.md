# Aria

This repository contains training, inference, and evaluation code for the paper [*Scaling Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Symbolic Piano Performance (ISMIR 2025)*](https://example.com/), as well as implementations of our real-time piano continuation demo. *Aria* is a pretrained autoregressive generative model for symbolic music, based on the LLaMA 3.2 (1B) architecture, which was trained on ~60k hours of MIDI transcriptions of expressive solo-piano recordings. Alongside the base model, we are releasing a checkpoint finetuned to improve generative quality, as well as a checkpoint finetuned to produce general-purpose piano MIDI embeddings using a SimCSE-style contrastive training objective.

## Installation 

Installation requires Python 3.11+. To install the package and all dependencies with pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EleutherAI/aria 
cd aria
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

## Quickstart

Download model weights from the official HuggingFace page for our pretrained model, as well as checkpoints finetuned for piano-continuation and generating MIDI-embeddings:

### Inference (Prompt Continuation)

We provide optimized model implementations for PyTorch (CUDA) and MLX (Apple Silicon). You can generate continuations of a MIDI file using the CLI, e.g., using CUDA (Linux):

```bash
aria generate \
    --backend torch_cuda \
    --checkpoint_path <path-to-model-weights> \
    --prompt_midi_path <path-to-midi-file-to-continue> \
    --prompt_duration <length-in-seconds-for-prompt> \
    --variations <number-of-variations-to-generate> \
    --temp 0.98 \
    --min_p 0.035 \
    --length 2048 \
    --save_dir <dir-to-save-results>
```

Since the model has not been post-trained with instruction tuning or RLHF (similar to pre-instruct GPT models), it is very sensitive to input quality and performs best when prompted with well-played music. To get prompt MIDI files, see the `example-prompts/` directory, explore the [Aria-MIDI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/loubb/aria-midi) dataset, or transcribe your own files using our [piano-transcription model](https://github.com/EleutherAI/aria-amt). For a full list of sampling options: `aria generate -h`. If you wish to do inference on the CPU, please see the platform-agnostic implementation on our HuggingFace page [link].

### Intended Use and Limitations

Aria performs best when **continuing existing piano MIDI files** rather than generating music from scratch. While multi-track tokenization and generation are supported, the model was trained primarily on **single-track expressive piano performances**, and we recommend using single-track inputs for optimal results.

Due to the high representation of popular classical works (e.g., Chopin) in the training data and the difficulty of complete deduplication, the model may **memorize or closely reproduce** such pieces. For more original outputs, we suggest prompting Aria with **lesser-known works or your own compositions**.

### Inference (MIDI embeddings)

You can generate embeddings from MIDI files using the `aria.embeddings` module. This is primarily exposed with the `get_global_embedding_from_midi` function, for example:

```python
from aria.embeddings import get_global_embedding_from_midi
from aria.model import TransformerEMB, ModelConfig
from aria.config import load_model_config
from ariautils.tokenizer import AbsTokenizer

# Load model
model_config = ModelConfig(**load_model_config(name="medium-emb"))
model_config.set_vocab_size(AbsTokenizer().vocab_size)
model = TransformerEMB(model_config)
state_dict = load_file(filename=CHECKPOINT_PATH)
model.load_state_dict(state_dict=state_dict, strict=True)

# Generate embedding
embedding = get_global_embedding_from_midi(
    model=model,
    midi_path=MIDI_PATH,
    device="cpu",
)
```

Our embedding model was trained to capture composition-level and performance-level attributes, and therefore might not be appropriate for every use case.

## Real-time demo

In `demo/` we provide CUDA (Linux/PyTorch) and MLX (Apple Silicon) implementations of the real-time interactive piano-continuation demo showcased in our release blog post. For the demo we used an acoustic Yamaha Disklavier piano with simultaneous MIDI input and output ports connected via a standard MIDI interface. 

‚ùó**NOTE**: Responsiveness of the real-time demo is dependent on your system configuration, e.g., GPU FLOPS and memory bandwidth.

A MIDI input device is not strictly required to play around with the demo: By using the `--midi_path` and `--midi_through` arguments you can mock real-time input by playing from a MIDI file. All that is required are MIDI drivers (e.g., CoreMIDI, ALSA) and a virtual software instrument (e.g., Fluidsynth, Pianoteq) to render the output. 

Example usage (MLX):

```bash
MIDI_PATH="example-prompts/pokey_jazz.mid"

python demo/demo_mlx.py \
    --checkpoint <checkpoint-path> \
    --midi_path ${MIDI_PATH} \
    --midi_through <port-to-stream-midi-file-through> \  
    --midi_out <port-to-stream-generation-over> \
    --save_path <path-to-save-result> \
    --temp 0.98 \
    --min_p 0.035
```

## Evaluation

We provide the specific files/splits we used for Aria-MIDI derived linear-probe and classification evaluations. These can be downloaded from HuggingFace ([direct-download](https://huggingface.co/loubb/aria-medium-base/resolve/main/eval-splits.tar.gz?download=true)). Class labels are provided in `metadata.json` with the schema:

```json
{
  "<category>": {
    "<split-name>": {
      "<relative/path/to/file.mid>": "<metadata_value_for_that_category>",
      ...
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```
